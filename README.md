# Ventilation_controller_cc
A custom component for Home Assistant that allows the remote controller of your Ramses RF setup to continually send ventilations commands to your ventilation unit based on the current air quality in your house. The air quality is a number from 0 to 5, and is based on various sensors that you can add to the controller.
